Here are the notes from Ford with more details:
42 "app store" collaboration, discussion points.
================================================
What is an app store:
---------------------
A set of management tools to be used for the deployment, authorisation, deletion etc for in car apps.
What is an app:
---------------
Composed of at least two segments:
 - Passive part: Metadata describing payload (permissions, icon, description, dev details, segment descriptions...)
 - Car Payload: Active part in car: Python 3 for test purposes; no assumptions should be made about content of payload, metadata should describe every aspect.
Additional segments of app present as needed:
 - Active part on BID: No real active part for this exercise, simply use browser to show HTML5 served from the car or cloud or both.
 - Active part in cloud: python? java?
Management tools:
-----------------
Cloud based back end:
 - Push car segment to app-engine in car (No BID involvment?)
Web based front end(s) for 'app store':
 - Collect / Store developer creds to cloud 
 - Collect / Store customer creds to cloud 
 - Store / delete / update apps to cloud repo
 - Download / Deploy / delete whole app
 - Delete / Deploy car segment
Project delivery:
Demonstration?
Project completion when:
Minimally:
 - Developer can upload an app.
 - Customer can see app in store and download it to device.
 - Administrator can manage customer and developer accounts.
Extra credit for:
 - Full management of in car apps.
 - Full administration of client records.
 - Full administration of developer records.
 - User / Developer / Adminstrator documentation.
 - User experience.
 - Proper recognition and documentation of system limitations.
All code presented in style appropriate for the language, brief documentation (user manual) for interactions related to app deployment, authorisation, deletion etc.
No obvious security issues; Everything signed, every information exchange encrypted, all users of any part of system authenticated etc. etc.
